 Database Specifications  
 
Introduction.  
 
A Map is a representation of geographic features and places and their spatial relationships 
to one another, to a scale on a paper or other physical media. A map usually, provides a  
large  amount spatial of information, in a relatively small space. However, there is still a 
great deal of information about geographic features, that could not be practically shown on 
a map, due to lack of pace.  
 
It takes a significant amount of time for retri eval of information from a map, partly due to 
the time taken for retrieve a map itself from where it is stored, and to retrieve information 
itself.  
 
With the advent of computer and information technology, and it’s impact on Automated or 
Digital Mapping, it  has become possible to store a vast amount of map information in a 
much less physical storage space, with the ability for faster retrieval of information as 
well.  
 
However, there is further great deal of information, related to geographic features, that 
cannot be handled even in the automated mapping as they are in the form of attribute  
information to the map features.  
 
With the development of Data Base Management Systems, it has become possible to 
manage these attribute information that cannot be physic ally placed on a map.  
 
The Geographic Information System (GIS) is a combination of Digital Mapping and 
Database Management System. This has the ability to link, spatial information to attribute 
information, and to retrieve & analyze spatially related infor mation including the attribute 
information and related geographic features.  
 
This specification and the data dictionary is aimed at documenting the ways in which the 
geographic data and attribute information is organised in the GIS dada base designed and 
compiled by the Survey Department of Sri Lanka.  
 
In principle, there is no single correct procedure for database design. The major 
factors that influence a GIS database design, are the data requirements of the 
applications that will be developed, availabili ty and the format of existing 
topographic data, update and maintenance procedures, size of the data base, 
hardware configuration, data model of the software used, number and organizational 
structure of users, cost involved and management support.

 The Map  Sheet dimensions and Neat  line Dimensions and Position.  
 
 
1:50,000 Map sheet . 
 
The map dimensions are 0.8m west -east and 0.5 m south -north representing the ground 
dimensions of 40,000m X 25000 m area. (1000 sq. km).  
 
The neat lines for all sheets form the positions of grid index map for 1: 50,000 sheets. For 
eg. Sheet number 76 is positioned at 200,000 N, 150,000 E (SW corner) and 240,000 N, 
175,000 E (NE corner).  
 
1:10,000 Map sheet  
 
The map dimensions are 0.8m west -east and 0.5 m south -north representing the ground 
dimensions of 8000 m X 5000 m. (40 sq. km)  
 
The neat lines for all sheets form the positions of grid index map for 1: 10,000 sheets. For 
eg. Sheet number 76/14 is positioned at 160,000 N, 224,000 E (SW corn er) and 165,000 
N, 232,000 E (NE corner).  
 
Grid lines . 
 
The grid lines are the linear features that defines the individual map sheet limits & internal 
grids, and are placed in a separate coverage called GRID. These lines are also used to 
close polygons at the sheet limit.  
 
Sheet/Tile Numbering.  
 
Each Map sheet or tile or workspace is numbered as shown below.  
 
1:50,000 sheets  01 to 92 to represent 92 map sheets, of 1:50,000 scale.  
 
1:10,000 sheets  0101 to 9225 to represent 1/1 to 92/25 sheets.  
There are 25  such sheets to cover one 50,000 sheet area. Since some 
sheets may not contain any data, one would find some sheet 
numbers do not exist in the database.  It is estimated that there are 
1834 sheets of this nature.  
 
1:2,000 sheets   010101 to 922525 to repres ent 1/1/1 to 92/25/25 sheets.  
There are 25 such sheets to cover one 10,000 sheet area. Since some 
sheets may not contain any data, one would find some sheet 
numbers do not exist in the database.   
 
1:1,000 sheets   010101A to 922525D to represent 1/1/1/A t o 92/25/25/D sheets.  
There are 4 such sheets to cover one 2,000 sheet area. Since some 
sheets may not contain any data, one would find some sheet 
numbers do not exist in the database.

 Features.  
 
All features in the database are listed below under the Data Dictionary, indicating the 
feature name, code, definition, and rules of compilation wherever necessary.  
 
Attributes . 
 
There are a number of different user attributes attached to features in the database listed in 
the features.  
 
Layers.  
 
A layer is a l ogical collection of geographic features with common characteristics. There 
are nine (09) layers plus a NEAT layer available for the data base.  
 
TICs  
 
Four TICs are in each coverage as control points for scale and orientation of digital data. 
They are numb ered as TIC -ID 1 (SW corner), TIC -ID 2 (NW corner), TIC -ID 3 (NE 
corner), and TIC -ID 4 (SE corner) at four corners of the neat line.  
 
Vector Data Model  
 
The data model used is the ARC/INFO data model. Layers of data are stored in a package 
called a ‘Covera ge’. Attributes for features are maintained in INFO data files. Some of 
these (eg. LENGTH, AREA etc) are generated as a standard to ARC/INFO coverage and 
some are user identified as specified in the Data Dictionary. The coordinates are in two 
dimensional, and are stored in double precision.  
 
The feature types of geometric data used are as follows. These features are defined by the 
coordinate positions of New Conformal Coordinates.  
 
Point   Zero dimensional object formed by a single coordinate pair.  
 
Tic  A graphic element formed by a single coordinate pair. It is used as a  
reference marker linking a graphic input device with the features in the  
coverage.  
 
Arc  One dimensional object formed by a sequence of coordinate pairs. Each  
coordinate  pair is referred a to as a vertex.  
 
Node   Zero dimensional object formed by a single coordinate pair, and is either  
the beginning or ending vertex of one or more Arcs.  
 
Polygon  Two dimensional object formed by one or more sequences of one or more  
interc onnected arcs.  
 
 
 
 
Tabular Data Model . 

4 | P a g e  
Topographic Database Specifications & Data Dictionary – Survey Department  
  
The tabular data model used is the Database Management System of ARC/INFO called 
INFO. The data types that can be used in INFO are as follows.  
 
B Binary   Number, stored as a binary integer. It can have an implied dec imal  
point.  
 
C  Character  Fixed length character string up to 4096 bytes (characters)  
 
D Date   Date field, stored internally as YYYYMMDD  
 
F Floating  Number stored in Floating point format.  
 
I Integer   Number( Integer) item up to 16 bytes (digits), with no decimal  
point.  
 
N Number  Number with decimal places. Can have up to 16 bytes (digits)  
including the decimal point.  
 
Coordinate System  & Datum . 
 
All coordinates are in meters according to the New conformal co ordinate system and is 
based on the Transverse Mercator Projection with the following parameters.  
 
Transformation Parameters   -  WGS 84 to Everest Ellipsoid  
 
Shifts  X= 0.2933  
 Y= -766.9499  
 Z= -87.7131

 Accuracy.  
 
The accuracy of the planimmetric data is within +/ - 2.5 m of their true positions on the 
ground for 1:10,000 and +/ - 12.5 m of their true positions on the ground for 1:50,000 
mapping data.  
 
Similarly the accuracy of the planimetric data is within +/ - 25 cm of their true positions on 
the ground for 1:1,000 and +/ - 50 cm of their true positions on the ground for 1:2,000  
mapping data  
 
This represents 0.25 mm at the map scale.  
  
 
Accuracy of height data  
 
The accuracy of the height data is within +/ - 1 m of their true elevations on the ground for 
1:10,000 and +/ - 3 m of their true elevations on the ground for 1:50,000 mapp ing data.  
 
The above figures represent the maximum allowed error in position. Some data collected 
and compiled by more precise methods have better accuracy.  
 
Compilation Rules .  
 
The linear features that are equal or longer than 2.5 m, and area features that are larger 
than 2.5 X 2.5 m^2 (with the exception of Roads which are compiled as linear features 
only) will be the compiled in case of 1:10,000 scale of compilation and it will  be 12.5 m 
for linear and 12.5X12.5 m^2 for area features in case of 1:50,000 scale of  compilation.  
 
Similarly the linear features that are equal or longer than 25 cm, and area features that are 
larger than 25 X 25 cm^2 will be the compiled in case of 1:1 ,000 scale of compilation and 
it will be 50 cm for linear and 50X50 cm^2 for area features in case of 1:2,000 scale of  
compilation.  
 
Quality Assurance .  
 
A number of steps have been taken to ensure the quality of data under the following 
primary areas .  
 
1. Positional accuracy of the content,  
 
2. Completeness of the content.  
 
3. Edge matching to assure the continuity of features running into more than one sheet.

Feature Definitions  
 
Note:  
 
We shall start spending time on this once the other parts are finalised. The purpose of 
documenting feature definition is to identify the features without any ambiguity. Since 
most features in our data base are self defined, some of them need not be define d at all. 
However there is a need to include ‘Rules of Compilation’ for each feature. But features 
like Main Road, Secondary Road, Lane, Track, need clear definitions.
